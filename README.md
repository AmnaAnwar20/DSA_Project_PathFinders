To install the pygame library: <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) open Command Prompt/Terminal> write 'pip install pygame' and press enter <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) if the above method doesn't work and running the code says that pygame is not installed then go for the following method: <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - write 'import sys' on the python shell and press enter> write 'sys.executable' and copy the path returned by this command> open Command Prompt/Terminal and press enter <br />         after pasting the path> press enter after writing 'pip install pygame'
Open the 'maze generator.py' file and run it (or press F5). <br /> 
After the maze window opens, press space bar to start the simulation.  <br />
Press the up arrow key to move to the next step of simulation. <br /> 
A random maze will be generated each time and the user will be shown the shortest path to solve this maze which will be shown on the maze window. <br />
Unmute speakers as there is music in the simulation to make it more interactive. <br />
